# File Handling Assignment README

## Overview
This Python script (`file_handling_assignment.py`) demonstrates basic file handling operations such as file creation, reading, appending, and error handling.

## Description
The script performs the following tasks:
1. **File Creation:** Creates a new text file named "my_file.txt" in write mode ('w') and writes three lines of text to it, including a mix of strings and numbers.
2. **File Reading and Display:** Reads the contents of "my_file.txt" and displays them on the console.
3. **File Appending:** Opens "my_file.txt" in append mode ('a') and appends three additional lines of text to the existing content.
4. **Error Handling:** Implements error handling using try, except, and finally blocks to manage potential file-related exceptions such as FileNotFoundError and PermissionError.
